Wrap the input as a reactive expression foo = reactive({rv$foo}) Even is already input$num Pass the reactive expression to the module as an argument e.g. module(data = foo) [No brackets] Treat the argument as a reactive expression withint the function (e.g. data()) 2.9 Effective use of Shiny Modules 2.9.1 Careful design What does the module do? What is it trying to accomplish? What should I call my module? 2.9.2 Inputs and return values Static or reactive inputs? Complexity of return values Which outputs serve as inputs for other modules? Document your modules (roxygen2 @param @return) When to ()? function(input, output, foo) foo() return(foo) plot1vars$xvar() NOT plot1vars2()$xvar "],

The more knowdlege the better Application not just theory Attiude &amp; business 5.4 Chapter 5 - Choosing a statistical technique Get clients to clarify objectives What do you hope to answer by running that analysis How will you know if you’ve answered your question It’s one this to know how to do a t-test, another to know when do do it and what it means When you have a choice, use the methods you understand well Don’t offer colutions that are beyond the comprehension of the client (or his ability to describe them) The simple graph is a major consulting virtue (Sometimes all you need!) Simple techniques are easier to give good time &amp; money estimates Confirm who is doing the analysis - client or consultant How much analysis does the client need to understand - and at what level Use techniques already accepted in the (client’s) field Choose the simplest technique that will do the job, not the fanciest technique you can handle If the client’s solution is decent, don’t push yours unless necessary Help with the data collection and questioning Push for client understanding Agree work division before deciding a technique Writing * Write sooner than you think * Avoid technical jargon * Keep tone friendly &amp; helpful * Short, simple and concise Remember the target if your client’s audience. What will persuade them. Get to know the subcultural - which arguments are the most convincing? 5.5 Chater 7 Business aspects of consulting What tasks need to be done Who will do them Who gets the credit Project time Project funding How will you get paid, and when? Who decides when the work is done? Who does the quality control of variables? What sort of consultant-client relationship Determine any other involved parties and roles Who signs off on the final report, who writes it? How will my analysis be presented - do I have any control over this? Will I prepare a written report of my activities? Stakeholder mapping? Check in with your feelings before writing this to ensure correct tone (friendly &amp; helpful) Be kind, firm, fair and empathetic Time estimates Break into chunks Review data before the final time estimate It doesn’t matter how good it is if it isn;t on time Listen to everyone who asks for a consult, but triage Are you talking to the real client or a messenger? Discuss time &amp; money early on Communicate any delays or unexpected costs You’re responsible for time/money of services you employ Allocate responsbilities without coming across as legalistic "]
